# How Inflation and Interest Rates Impact Consumer Spending

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending over time to understand how macroeconomic conditions influence consumer behavior. Using publicly available economic data, the analysis explores trends, correlations, and timing effects that can inform business and policy decisions.

## Business Question
How do changes in inflation and interest rates affect consumer spending patterns over time?

## Data Sources
All data was sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED):
- Consumer Price Index (CPI) – inflation
- Federal Funds Rate – interest rates
- Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) – consumer spending

## Tools Used
- SQL: Data cleaning, joins, aggregations, and time-based calculations
- Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- GitHub: Version control and project documentation

## Analysis Approach
1. Cleaned and standardized time-series data using SQL  
2. Joined multiple economic indicators by date  
3. Calculated month-over-month and year-over-year changes  
4. Analyzed trends before and after major inflation spikes and interest rate changes  
5. Visualized relationships using an interactive Tableau dashboard  

## Key Insights
- Consumer spending growth tends to slow during periods of high inflation.
- Interest rate increases often show a delayed impact on spending, typically several months after rate hikes.
- Periods of sustained high interest rates are associated with reduced growth in discretionary consumer spending.

## Business Implications
- Businesses may need to adjust pricing strategies and inventory planning during high-inflation or high-rate environments.
- Understanding lag effects can help organizations anticipate changes in consumer demand rather than reacting too late.

## Deliverables
- SQL scripts used for data cleaning and analysis
- Cleaned dataset
- Interactive Tableau dashboard
